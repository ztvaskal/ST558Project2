## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r readInOnlineNewsPopularityDataset, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Read-in entire dataset
path <- "C:/Users/Zachary Vaskalis/Dropbox/ST558/ST558Project2/ST558Project2/OnlineNewsPopularity.csv"
weekdayDataRAW <- read_csv(path)

# Select only variables I am choosing to use for the analysis.
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
