# Introduction

This project uses the Online News Popularity Data Set which can be found
at the University of California Irvine [UCI Machine Learning Repository,
Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent
Systems](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity#).
The dataset being used here was compiled by several researchers in
Portugal, who collected articles from [Mashable](www.mashable.com) and
compiled associated statistics for a period of two years, with the goal
of being able to predict the number of shares in social networks (a
measure of popularity). The dataset has over 39,000 records of
information spanning the two year time period from January 07, 2013 to
December 27th, 2014. The dataset also contains 61 variables, of which 58
are predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive variables(the source url and
the time between article publication and dataset acquisition), and
finally the goal field for prediction: the number of shares.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
